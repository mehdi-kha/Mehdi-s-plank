# Mehdi's Plank

This project is a leisure side project based on the principle of Richie's plank experience https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1642239225880682
It is made for the Oculus Quest.

## Technical notes

MRTK is used to handle objects and hands interactions with the Oculus Quest. The different objects come from free assets from the Unity Asset Store.

### What could be improved
- There are sometimes FPS drops to 40 fps when looking at the cars in the street.
- The cars object pooling system is to be improved.
- Improve the scene orientation: right now if the game is launched when the user is looking towards a wall physically present in their environment, the virtual plank will appear to go through that wall.
